            A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly
            between cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes. Most wedding ceremonies involve
            an exchange of marriage vows by a couple, presentation of a gift (offering, rings, symbolic item, flowers,
            money, dress), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant. Special wedding
            garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception. Music, poetry,
            prayers, or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony, as
            well as superstitious customs.
