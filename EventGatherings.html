        Social gathering is defined as interactions among a diversity of individuals of all abilities in small, medium
        and large groups for social and community purposes. Street life used to be an integral part of the social life
        of people. Friends met and hung out on the street, children played there, neighbors caught up with each other,
        and people watched people. This kind of vibrant street life has been greatly reduced over the years primarily
        due to the increase in vehicular traffic on the street. Donald Appleyardâ€™s seminal study "Liveable Streets"
        (1982) showed that social connections between people on a street were inversely proportionate to the amount of
        traffic. In addition there is a perception that social activities on the streets might block traffic or increase
        crime. There are also concerns that that there will not be adequate maintenance of the spaces and an increase in
        liability for the city.
